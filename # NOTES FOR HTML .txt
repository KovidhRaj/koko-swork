6) FORMS AND INPUT TAGS

<form action ="backend.php"> </form> with this you can create a backend for your HTML form
and also by using <fieldset> and <legend> you can make a box for your form and you also need to 
use <table> tags just to make it in proper format and also us other input tags
most basic tag is <input type="text" value="enter name">

<br> using this tag can give you your data type on the next line
but use <br> tag only after you've used <div> tag (most important for forms).

for submitting your form use submit button by <input type="submit" value="submit">
<input type="date" name="myDate"> name is used for recognising the data type at your form's backend.

 input can also include number,radio,checkbox.

<lable for="M"> can also be used as per your convenience.
 the most important tag for a form is <select name="name"> tag and <option value="cars"> tags all the time. 

7) INLINE AND BLOCK ELEMENTS

<span> is an inlinr element

8) IDS AND CLASSES
<div id="c" class="redbg">
so in this we can include ID to only one element as it is a unique format and specified for only one element
secondly we can can call class as an element which be for large scale or small scale.\

ctrl+/ will give you an automated comment tag.

9) ENTITIES
 nbps; is actually waste of time but can be used to give spaces between texts as per the situation.
if you ever want to print <p> in the html website then you can use (&ltp&gt)* well might not be important but can be used as per your
convenience.
 if you need more entities you can go to html entities reference.
