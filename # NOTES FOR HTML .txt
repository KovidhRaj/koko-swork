6) FORMS AND INPUT TAGS

<form action ="backend.php"> </form> with this you can create a backend for your HTML form
and also by using <fieldset> and <legend> you can make a box for your form and you also need to 
use <table> tags just to make it in proper format and also us other input tags
most basic tag is <input type="text" value="enter name">

<br> using this tag can give you your data type on the next line
but use <br> tag only after you've used <div> tag (most important for forms).

for submitting your form use submit button by <input type="submit" value="submit">
<input type="date" name="myDate"> name is used for recognising the data type at your form's backend.

 input can also include number,radio,checkbox.

<lable for="M"> can also be used as per your convenience.
 the most important tag for a form is <select name="name"> tag and <option value="cars"> tags all the time. 

7) INLINE AND BLOCK ELEMENTS

<span> is an inlinr element

8) IDS AND CLASSES
<div id="c" class="redbg">
so in this we can include ID to only one element as it is a unique format and specified for only one element
secondly we can can call class as an element which be for large scale or small scale.\

ctrl+/ will give you an automated comment tag.

9) ENTITIES
 nbps; is actually waste of time but can be used to give spaces between texts as per the situation.

Other tips for HTML Beginners
1. Use a Modern Text Editor
Tools like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provide syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and other helpful features. VS Code also supports Emmet for faster HTML and CSS coding.

2. Utilize Emmet
Emmet is a plugin available in many text editors that allows you to write HTML and CSS more quickly. For example, typing ul>li*5 and then pressing 'Tab' will create a <ul> element with five <li> children as shown below:

<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
3. Indent Your Code
Properly indenting your code makes it more readable. Most modern text editors offer automatic indentation.

4. Always Close Tags
Make sure to close all of your HTML tags. This helps to avoid unexpected rendering issues.

5. Learn CSS and JavaScript
Understanding CSS and JavaScript can help you create more dynamic and visually appealing websites. Consider studying them alongside HTML.

6. Use Comments Wisely
Comments can be helpful for leaving notes and reminders in your code, or for temporarily disabling a section of HTML.

7. Practice Regularly
Like any skill, practice makes perfect. Try building different types of web pages to improve your understanding and proficiency in HTML.

8. Learn about Responsive Design
Responsive design ensures that your website looks good on all devices. Learning about media queries and flexible grid layouts is essential for modern web development.
