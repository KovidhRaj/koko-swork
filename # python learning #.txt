# python learning #

1) Comments in a python 

USUALLY WE USE (#) IN PYTHON FOR WRITTING A PYTHON COMMENT BUT WE CAN ALSO USE( ''' ASADAS ''')
WHICH IS ALSO CALLED A MULTILINE COMMENT USED TO WRITE COMMENT IN MULTIPLE LINES

2) STRING IN PYTHON

we can directly write (string = "kiovoov") unlike c or c++ where you needed to specify the this is a string and point it out using pointer

3) VARIABLES IN PYTHON 

in python we can directly represent a variable using words but they might not be needed to represent various variables and moreover in python we will have NUMBERS,STRINGS,LISTS,TUPLES,DICTIONARIES.

4) OPERATORS IN PYTHON
 
print("The sum of 3+2 =",3+2)
print("the diff between 5-2 =",5-2)
print("the multipl between 5*2 =",5*2)
print("the diff between 4/2 =",4/2)

5) MORE ABOUT STRING

print("%s"%('this is string'))
print('this is a print statment 1' end ="")
print('this is a print statment 2')
print(" Gauri "*5)

6) #LISTS

# LISTS
Colleges = ["IIT","NIT","IIIT","GFTI"]
print(Colleges[0])

## WE CAN ALSO ALTER THE ORIGINAL LIST IN PYTHON ##
 
Colleges[3] = "COEP"
print(Colleges)

Colleges.append("GFTI")
print(Colleges)

Colleges.insert(2,'COEP')
print(Colleges)

Colleges.remove('NIT')
print(Colleges)

Colleges.remove('COEP')
print(Colleges)
print(len(Colleges))

7) # TUPLES

tup1 = (1,2,3)
list1 =list(tup1)
print(list1)
print(tup1[1])

8) # DICTIONARIES

names = {'kovidh':20,
         'gauri': 17,
         'raghav': 40,
         'koeako': 50}
print(names['raghav'])

names['raghav'] = 90

print(names['raghav'])
print(names.keys())
print(names.values())


9)# IF/ELSE STATEMENTS

print("please enter name: ")
name = input()
print("please enter number: ")
number = int(input())
if(number>30):
    print("you can have drinks like beer and vodka")
elif(number<30):
    print("you are under age and cannot drink")
else:
    print("please exit the BAR")


10) # LOOPS

# FOR LOOP

print("Enter number: ")
n = int(input())
for i in range(0,10):
    print(n*i)
list1 = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
for item in list1:
    for i in item:
        print(i)

# WHILE LOOP

print("enter your prefered numebr: ")
n = int(input())
if(n<5):
        print("sorry the code cannot run!!!")

while(n>5):
    print(n+1)
    break

11) #  FUNCTION WORKING WITH PYTHON

def Average(num1, num2):
    return (num1+num2)/2
print(Average(4, 4))

12) # STRING IN PYTHON

string = "this is a string"
print(string[0:16]) #writes everything
print(string[-2:]) #it only writes last two elements
print(string[0:-2]) #it deletes last two elements
print(string[:-2]) #same as above
print(string[-2:0]) #nothing
print(string.capitalize()) #it capitalises only the first element of the sentence
print(string.find("is"))
print(string.replace("a","the"))

13) FILE IO (WRITING THE CONTENTS)

# FILE IO

file1 = open("koko.txt","wb")
print(file1.mode)
print(file1.name)
file1.write(bytes("this is what im gonna write in the notes","UTF-8"))
file1.close()

# FILE IO (READING THE CONTENTS)

# FILE IO- READING THE CONTENETS OF THE FILES

file1 = open("koko.txt","r+")
contents = file1.read()
print(contents)

# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

class Employee:
    _name = None
    _id = 0
    _salary = 0

    def _init_(self,name,id):#constructer
        self._name = name
        self._id = id

    def set_name(self,name):
        self._name = name
    def get_name(self):
        return self._name
    def set_id(self,id):
        self._id = id
    def get_id(self):
        return self._id


kovidh = Employee()
#print(kovidh.get_id())
kovidh.set_name('kovidh')
print(kovidh.get_name())

kovidh.set_id('KOKO0909')
print(kovidh.get_id())
