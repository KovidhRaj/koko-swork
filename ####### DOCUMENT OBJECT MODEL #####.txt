####### DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL #########


1) text decoration (we usually take it as none)(we can use line through).
2) we use <style> tag to connect html with css.
3) we use <script> tag to connect html with js.
4) most common code to connect css file with html file is <link rel = "stylesheets" href = "lllsxslll.css"/>
5) we can use <script> tag just before </body> or </head> tag to initiate the connection of javascript to html.
6) use of some javascript tags such as alert or prompt are so powerfull that the webpage can wait some time just to operate for that javascript code to run.
7) in the inspect setting of the chrome of the google the key main elements while checking for the code are ELEMENETS AND CONSOLE.
8) in the elements section we usually get HTML content and we can also explore the CSS part in the elements itself just below it we can find styles section.
9) These starter codes are really usefull as they make the code more READABLE,MODULAR,BROWSER CACHING.
10) WINDOW OBJECT: it is a browser's object and is automatically created by browser.
and it is a global object with a lots of properties and methods.
11) window.console.log() is also functionable.
12) When the all the code of the html are converted into the javascript objects document and they are located in the window.
13) console.dir() is used for printing special documents and properties of the window object.
14) ChildNodes are the representation of the all the tags and css code used for ones webpage and these code are the in the hierarchical order.

THEREFORE THE DOM IS THE USED TO WORK ON HTML USING JAVASCRIPT WITHOUT TOUCHING THE HTML CODES. JAVASCRIPT CAN BE USED TO DYNAMICALLY OR REMOTELY CHANGE THE HTML CODE

15) DOM MANIPULATION:

i) SELECTING WITH ID:
document.getElementById("#myid")

ii)SELECTING WITH CLASS
document.getElementsByClassName(".myClass")

iii) SELECTING WITH TAG
document.getElementsByTagNmae("p")

# HTML COLLECTION ARE VERY SIMILAR TO ARRAYS

16) WE CAN ASLO USE QUERY SELECTORS TO SELECT OUR ELEMENTS

documents.querySelectors("#myId/.myClass/tag")
//returns first elements.

documents.querySelectorsAll("id/class/tag")
//returns a NodeList


# PROPERTIES #

1)tagName: returns tag for elements nodes
2) innerText: retruns the text content of the elements and all its children
3) innerHTML: returns the plain text or HTML contents in the element
4) textContents: returns texutal contents even for the hidden elements.
